### Week 2 Achievements

- Deployed a web application with a custom domain and HTTPS termination via Cloudflare.
- Helped teammates standardize development environments (Linux/Windows) for smoother collaboration.
- Strengthened knowledge across key AWS services: EC2, ECS, ECR, EKS, VPC, and Lambda.
- Practiced scaling concepts with EC2 Auto Scaling and containerized deployment with Docker on EC2.

### Challenges and lessons learned

- DNS and certificate changes can take time to propagate; plan for TTLs and validate records before cutover.
- Mixing providers (Route 53 + Cloudflare) requires careful name server and SSL/TLS configuration.
- Environment setup differs across OSes—document a minimal, repeatable setup path for teammates.
- When troubleshooting deployments on EC2, start with security groups, NACLs, and instance logs.
