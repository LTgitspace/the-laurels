### Week 1 Achievements

- Gained a solid understanding of AWS fundamentals and the main service groups: Compute, Storage, Networking, and Database.
- Successfully created and configured an AWS Free Tier account.
- Became familiar with the AWS Management Console and how to find, access, and use services via the web UI.
- Installed and configured the AWS CLI, including Access Key, Secret Key, and default Region settings.
- Launched a test EC2 instance, connected via SSH, and attached an EBS volume.
- Deployed a simple static website to Amazon S3 for FCJ reporting.

### Challenges and lessons learned

- IAM permissions and key management require careful handling; least-privilege is essential.
- Security groups and networking settings (inbound/outbound rules) directly impact connectivity; validate them first when SSH fails.
- Region selection affects service availability and pricing—standardize on a primary region early.
